synopsis:            An HTTP Client based on Free Monads.

description:         `free-http` is an http-client based on Free Monads.
                     `free-http` exposes a Free Monad to express standard http
                     verbs as well as several backends to interpet programs
                     written in the free monad using various http clients
                     (currently: a pure client, an `http-client`-backed client,
                     and a random client).

                     To use free-http, simply:

                     1. Import Network.HTTP.Client.Free to use the library.
                     2. Choose your base request type by defining your own
                        instance of the `RequestType` type family or importing
                        one from an interpreter. E.g.

                        data MyClient
                        type instance RequestType MyClient = Request

                        (or)

                        import Network.HTTP.Free.Client.HttpClient (HttpClient)

                     3. Choose your base response type by defining your own
                        instance of the `ResponseTYpe` type family or importing
                        one from an interpreter. E.g. 

                        type instance ResponseType MyClient = Response ByteString

                        (or)

                        import Network.HTTP.Free.Client.HttpClient (HttpClient)

                     4. Write a program in the 'FreeHttp MyClient m a' free monad.
                     5. Import an interpreter, such as 'HttpClient'

                        import Network.HTTP.Free.Client.HttpClient

                     6. Run your program against the interpreter:

                        runHttp (myProgram :: FreeHttp MyClient IO String)
